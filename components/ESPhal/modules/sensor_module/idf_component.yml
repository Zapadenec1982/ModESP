  description: |
    SensorModule is a HAL module responsible for collecting data from all
    physical sensors. It contains all sensor drivers internally (DS18B20,
    NTC, GPIO) and provides standardized sensor data to SharedState.
    
    Sensor drivers are internal implementation details of SensorModule,
    following the principle that SensorModule creates and manages internal
    sensor objects as specified in the documentation.
    
    Modularity is achieved through JSON configuration and compile-time
    options, not through separate driver components.
