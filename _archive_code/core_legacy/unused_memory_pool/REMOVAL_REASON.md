# Memory Pool Removal - COMPLETED

## Decision
After analysis, we decided to monitor heap fragmentation instead of using memory pool.

## What was removed:
- memory_pool.cpp/h
- memory_diagnostics.cpp/h
- pooled_event.h

## What was added:
- Heap fragmentation monitoring in application.cpp
- Logging of largest free block
- Critical fragmentation detection

## Monitoring code:
```cpp
// In check_health()
size_t largest_free_block = heap_caps_get_largest_free_block(MALLOC_CAP_8BIT);

if (free_heap > 20480 && largest_free_block < 10240) {
    ESP_LOGW(TAG, "Heap fragmentation detected!");
}

// In main loop logging
ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Free heap: %zu KB, Largest block: %zu KB", 
         get_free_heap() / 1024, largest_block / 1024);
```

## Benefits:
- Simpler code (no memory pool complexity)
- Real-time monitoring of fragmentation
- Can decide on reboot strategy based on actual data
- Saved ~5-10KB code size

## Archive location:
`_archive_code/core_legacy/unused_memory_pool/`

## If fragmentation becomes a problem:
1. Check logs for "Heap fragmentation detected!"
2. If frequent - implement preventive reboot schedule
3. If critical - restore memory pool from archive
