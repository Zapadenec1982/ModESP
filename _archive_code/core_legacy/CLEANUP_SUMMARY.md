# Core Component Cleanup Summary

**Date**: ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}
**Component**: components/core/

## âœ… Actions Completed

### 1. Archived Files
- âœ… Moved duplicate `memory_pool.cpp/h` from `memory/` folder
- âœ… Moved `application_cpu_fix.cpp` to integration queue
- âœ… Moved `module_heartbeat_header_comment.txt` 
- âœ… Moved misplaced `heartbeat/` folder with manifest
- âœ… Moved outdated `examples/memory_pool_example.cpp`

### 2. Fixed Build System
- âœ… Removed non-existent `lazy_component_loader.cpp` from CMakeLists.txt
- âœ… Removed `memory` from INCLUDE_DIRS (folder no longer exists)

### 3. Kept Active Components
- âœ… Application lifecycle system (application.cpp/h, wrapper)
- âœ… Event system (event_bus, helpers) - WITHOUT runtime validation  
- âœ… State management (shared_state)
- âœ… Config system (sync + async versions)
- âœ… Module system (manager, registry, factory, heartbeat)
- âœ… Memory pool system
- âœ… Utilities (diagnostics, error handling)

### 4. Documentation
- âœ… Created comprehensive README.md for core component

### 5. Fixed Build Process
- âœ… Discovered that build scripts didn't run code generation
- âœ… Updated build.bat to run process_manifests.py before build
- âœ… Updated build.ps1 to run process_manifests.py before build
- âœ… Resolved generated_events.h include issue

### 6. Removed EventValidator
- âœ… Deleted event_validator.cpp/h
- âœ… Removed runtime validation from event_bus.cpp
- âœ… Updated CMakeLists.txt
- âœ… Saved ~2-3KB RAM and CPU cycles

### 7. Reorganized Core Structure
- âœ… Created logical folder structure (src/, utils/)
- âœ… Organized by subsystem (application/, modules/, config/, events/, state/)
- âœ… Consolidated module_registry + module_factory â†’ module_lifecycle
- âœ… Updated CMakeLists.txt and all includes
- âœ… From 23 files chaos to 20 files organized

## ðŸ“Š Results

**Before**: 51 files across multiple nested folders
**After**: 20 organized files in logical structure
- 15 files in `src/` (organized by subsystem)
- 5 files in `utils/`
- Plus configs/, include/, schemas/

**Archive location**: `_archive_code/core_legacy/`

## ðŸš§ Follow-up Tasks

1. **HIGH**: Integrate CPU usage fix from archived file
2. **LOW**: Consider reorganizing module manifests
3. **LOW**: Clean up empty `src/` and `examples/` folders (already done)

## âœ¨ Impact

- Cleaner, more maintainable structure
- No more duplicate files
- Build system properly reflects actual files
- Clear documentation for team members
- Preserved all potentially useful code in archive
