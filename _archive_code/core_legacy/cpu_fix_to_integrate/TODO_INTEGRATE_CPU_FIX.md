# TODO: Integrate CPU Fix

The file `application_cpu_fix.cpp` contains an improved implementation of `get_cpu_usage()` function that provides real CPU usage measurement using idle task runtime tracking.

## Current situation:
- Main file: `application.cpp` contains a "fake" CPU usage calculation based on main loop timing
- Fix file: `application_cpu_fix.cpp` contains proper implementation using FreeRTOS idle task statistics

## Action needed:
1. Review the implementation in `application_cpu_fix.cpp`
2. Replace the `get_cpu_usage()` function in `application.cpp` (lines ~411-450)
3. Test the new implementation thoroughly
4. Remove `application_cpu_fix.cpp` after integration

## Key differences:
- Current: Estimates CPU based on main loop timing
- Fix: Measures actual idle task runtime for accurate CPU usage

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Important for accurate system monitoring but not critical for operation
