## 🤝 AI Collaboration Best Practices

### For Each Coding Session

#### 1. Pre-Session Preparation
```bash
# Human Preparation:
- Read relevant documentation
- Understand requirements
- Prepare hardware setup
- Review existing code patterns

# AI Preparation:
- Analyze existing codebase
- Understand architecture patterns
- Prepare implementation strategies
- Generate test scenarios
```

#### 2. During Session Workflow
```
Planning (15 min) → Implementation (60-80%) → Testing (15-20%) → Documentation (5-10%)
     ↓                      ↓                    ↓                     ↓
Human: Requirements    AI: Code generation   Human: Hardware     AI: API docs
AI: Architecture      Human: Validation     AI: Unit tests      Human: Review
```

#### 3. Post-Session Actions
```bash
# Immediate:
git commit -m "feat(component): TODO-XXX complete implementation"
git push origin feature/TODO-XXX

# Within 24 hours:
- Update TODO.md status
- Document lessons learned
- Plan next session
- Share results with team
```
